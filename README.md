# PizzaSales

A small sql project I did using Postgresql. I have analyzed different situations, extract data about orders to see customer behaviour, trying to see if the business is working, and if there are any improvements that could be done in order to help the business grow.

Structure:
*months with the most orders;
*best selling pizzas;
*revenue per pizza and total revenue;
*customers per day;
*peak hours;
